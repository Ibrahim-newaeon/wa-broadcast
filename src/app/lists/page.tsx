          Each list keeps restorable snapshots of its membership. A snapshot is taken automatically before a
          CSV import, and you can take one anytime — then roll back with one click. Deleting a list removes its
          snapshots but keeps every contact in your address book — and once a list has been broadcast to,
          archive it instead: it leaves every picker while its sends keep their history.
